In Github there is a sequance you should respect when creating a repisotary and it goes like this:
First of all you have to create your reposotory and after wards you can do the following which is you can browse it or change files and add files.
then in changes you commit and update and after commiting you can make a branch or update or make a pull request.
after that you can revert what you have done and submit the changes then you can publish it.

So it goes like this:

Create>Browse and/or Change> Commit> Branch and/or Update and/or revert > Change > Update > Commit > Publish
